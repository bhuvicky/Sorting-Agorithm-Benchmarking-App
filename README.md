Sorting Algorithm BenchMarking Application, sort the array of primitive data. 
The array get generated based on the size and case (Best, Average, worst) what user given
After array get generated its gets sorted based on different sorting algorithms, what the user choose.
Once sorting gets finished, how much time it takes will be displayed as result.
Benchmark All option sort the array using all algorithm, so it takes too much time, so to improves performance, each sorting runs in a separate thread.
All the Exceptions are handled properly in this application.
